## For quadratic_general_formula.py
Note to self: this is parabola also its to get minimum or maximum and the two x intercepts
coords of vertex = h = -(b/2a) where h is x coord then since x coords is h then k = (ah^2 + bh + c) where k = y coords
vertex = minimum/maximum point or turning/stationary point
x intercepts = (-b +-(sqrt(b^2-4ac)))/2a
so for eg. x^2-25=0 a=1, b=0, c=-25 (-0 +-(sqrt(100)))/2 means x1 is 5 and x2 is -5
done with the help of Microsoft Copilot teaching me the graph
